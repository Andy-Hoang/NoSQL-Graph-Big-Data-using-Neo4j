# NoSQL-Graph-Big-Data-using-Neo4j
Migration from a relational database that was built on the previous Library relational database project to a NoSQL database 

In the scenario that data growing fast, migration from a relational database that was built on the previous Library relational database project to a NoSQL database was performed. Neo4j as the new database management platform was chosen that aims to provide better scalability in a Big Data environment.

Threre are following steps involved:
1. Graph Database Modelling: 
   // the existing EER diagram was converted into a graph mode
2. Graph Database Implementation: 
   // Cypher scripts were written to fully migrate the relational database into a Graph Neo4j database. Part A for importing relational data from .csv files into Neo4j database,         and also include scripts for creating nodes and relationships. Part B for creating Index.
3. Cypher queries: 
   // testing whether new Cypher query scripts produce results equivalent to the SQL queries in the previous relational database project.
4. Advanced Graph Algorithm: Jaccard Similarity algorithm:
   // to apply algorithms to solve complex big data challenges, such as how Netflix suggests related movies to its users.
